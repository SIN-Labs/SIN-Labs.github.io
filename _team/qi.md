description: "Qi is broadly interested in learning and memory, and how individual differences in these processes interact with other aspects of the mind. She recently completed her PhD in the Department of Psychology at Yale University, working primarily with Dr. Marvin Chun. Her doctoral research focused who remember better (individual differences), what gets remembered (memorability), and more importantly, why, using tools from psychophysics, computational modeling to neuroimaging. Before that, she received her B.A. from New York University, working in the laboratory of Dr. Elizabeth Phelps and spent a year as a lab manager in the laboratory of Dr. Daniela Schiller, studying the malleability of emotional memory."
