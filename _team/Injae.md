description: "Injae is interested in how humans efficiently (or inefficiently) deploy attention in complex visual scenes. Her previous works has primarily employed psychophysical methods, and now she is expanding her work to bridge brain and human behavior — exploring how brain stimulation may modulate cognitive performance. Outside the lab, she spends most of her time knitting."
