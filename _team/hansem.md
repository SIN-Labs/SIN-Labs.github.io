description: "My area of research is cognitive and systems neuroscience. I have been investigating how the brain measures and processes time using multiple approaches: behavioral experiments, computational modeling (e.g., Bayesian theory), human neuroimaging (EEG/fMRI), and electrophysiology in non-human primates. In my new lab, I will combine these techniques to study how the prefrontal and posterior parietal cortices process information about magnitude (time, number, and space)."
