                The Systems & Intervention Neuroscience (SIN) Lab is a collaborative initiative bringing together multiple labs and Principal Investigators (PIs) to explore the intricate mechanisms of brain function. Our research focuses on understanding brain circuits and networks using both invasive and non-invasive approaches in animal models. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge techniques, we aim to advance basic neuroscience and develop innovative interventions.

            Our center has received generous funding from the Institute for Basic Science (IBS) in Korea and Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). The center is equipped with some of the best MRI facilities in the world, accommodating both primates (humans and non-humans at 3T and 7T) and rodents (9.4T and 15.2T, with concurrent optogenetic stimulation and/or optical measurements of neurophysiology). This unique setup allows us to showcase the advantages of functional MRI research across different species, and importantly, to combine these approaches to tackle some of the most challenging questions in neuroscience.
