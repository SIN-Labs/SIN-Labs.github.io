        <p>The Systems & Intervention Neuroscience (SIN) is a collaborative initiative bringing together multiple labs and Principal Investigators (PIs) to explore the intricate mechanisms of brain function. Our research focuses on understanding brain circuits and networks using both invasive and non-invasive approaches in animal models. Through interdisciplinary collaboration and cutting-edge techniques, we aim to advance basic neuroscience and develop innovative interventions.</p>
