        <p>Our lab, co-directed by Prof. Hakwan Lau and supported by MR physicist Seong-Gi Kim, is located at the IBS Center for Neuroscience Imaging Research at Sungkyunkwan University, Korea. We are moving to Korea in September 2024 and are excited to build several new research groups in neuroimaging and related fields. With access to some of the world’s most advanced neuroimaging facilities (7T MRI for humans, 15.2T MRI for rodents, and more), we are looking for dedicated individuals to join us at all levels.</p>
        <p>We are actively recruiting for the following positions:</p>

            Postdoctoral Researchers
        </h3>
        <p>We are hiring postdoctoral researchers for various areas of neuroscience research. Funding is available for up to 10 years with potential internal promotions to faculty positions through open competition. Areas of focus include:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Human cognitive neuroscience (focus on perception, memory, and fMRI analysis related to mental imagery and mental health)</li>
            <li>Computational neuroimaging (real-time/closed-loop multivoxel pattern analysis, network control theory, traveling waves, etc.)</li>
            <li>Rodent electrophysiology and calcium imaging (perceptual decision-making, neurofeedback, fMRI)</li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <!-- PhD Students -->
    <div class="position-title" style="margin-left: 20px; margin-bottom: 30px;">
