## Research at Perceptual Intelligence Laboratories

Perceptual Intelligence Laboratories (PIL) is a multi-lab project with a shared goal of understanding the role of the prefrontal cortex in various perception modalities such as vision, hearing, touch, fear, and pain. Using a combination of neuroimaging techniques (e.g., fMRI and calcium imaging with optogenetic stimulations), we explore the perceptual mechanisms in both human and animal models (mice and macaques).

    <h2>Hakwan Lau</h2>
    <p>
      Hakwan Lau’s group focuses on refining the methods of MVPR (multivoxel pattern reinforcement) and conducting perceptual psychophysics studies in mice. His work also involves collecting electrophysiological data from prefrontal areas during perception tasks in macaques. Prior to joining PIL, Hakwan was a PI at Columbia University, UCLA, and RIKEN.

    <p>
      Ali Moharramipour’s group focuses on the multidimensional nature of perception and subjective similarity judgments. He uses both human neuroimaging and neurophysiological methods in mice to explore these mechanisms. Ali is scheduled to start his group in 2026.

    <h2>Upcoming Research Groups</h2>
    <p>
      Two additional groups are scheduled to start in 2025/26. One will focus on rodent neurophysiology, and another will concentrate on MVPR methods development, as well as human learning and metacognition.
