## Research 

Broadly, our group interested in the prefrontal cortex, especially mechanisms in the lateral, granular prefrontal cortex, which are relatively unique to primates, including humans. These mechanisms are typically associated with abstract thinking, action control, and attention. However, we believe they also play important roles in perception (broadly defined) and in metacognitionâ€”that is, the monitoring of ongoing cognitive and perceptual processes. The SIN group is particularly focused on developing methods for manipulating these mechanisms to assess their causal roles in cognitive functions.
One method we are currently developing is called hemodynamic pattern reinforcement, in which we treat fMRI not just as a tool for reading out signals from the brain, but also as a means to manipulate them. This is made possible through closed-loop (i.e., real-time) imaging methods, with which we pair the occurrence of specific activity patterns with reward or other stimuli. For example, we can pair the neural representation of a phobic target (e.g., spiders) with reward, thereby reducing its threat value and lowering excessive physiological arousal when the subject later encounters images of that target. We are currently working on ways to make this method more robust and effective.
To that end, we also conduct these studies in animal models, where we can simultaneously observe both hemodynamic activity and electrophysiological signals through optical (calcium) imaging. In these studies, we can also use optogenetic stimulation to target specific brain regions. This work draws on both the human MRI facilities at the center (7T) and the rodent MRI platforms (9.4T and 15.2T).
