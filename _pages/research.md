## Research 

Our group focuses on the prefrontal cortex—especially the lateral, granular region that is found only in primates, including humans. While this area is best known for its roles in abstract thought, action control, and attention, we argue that it also underlies perception (broadly defined) and metacognition—the monitoring of ongoing cognitive and perceptual processes. The SIN group therefore develops methods to manipulate these circuits so we can test their causal roles in cognition.

One technique we are refining is hemodynamic pattern reinforcement. Rather than treating fMRI solely as a readout, we use real-time, closed-loop imaging to pair the appearance of a chosen activity pattern with reward or other contingencies. For example, by coupling the neural representation of a phobic stimulus (e.g., spiders) with reward, we can reduce its threat value and dampen excessive physiological arousal when the subject later sees that stimulus. We are now working to make this approach even more robust and effective.

To advance the method, we run parallel studies in animal models, where we can record hemodynamic and electrophysiological signals simultaneously via optical (calcium) imaging and deliver optogenetic stimulation to specific circuits. This work draws on our 7 T human MRI scanner as well as our 9.4 T and 15.2 T rodent platforms, giving us an integrated, cross-species view of brain function.
