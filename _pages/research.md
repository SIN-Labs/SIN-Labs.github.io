      <!-- Paragraph 1 -->
      <p>
        Broadly, the SIN group is interested in the <b>prefrontal cortex (PFC)</b>, particularly mechanisms in the <b>lateral, granular PFC</b>, which are relatively unique to primates, including humans. These mechanisms are typically associated with <b>abstract thinking</b>, <b>action control</b>, and <b>attention</b>. However, we believe they also play important roles in <b>perception</b> (broadly defined) and in <b>metacognition</b>—that is, the monitoring of ongoing cognitive and perceptual processes. The SIN group is especially focused on developing methods to <b>manipulate these mechanisms</b> in order to assess their <b>causal roles</b> in cognitive functions.

      <p>
        One method we are currently developing is called <b>hemodynamic pattern reinforcement</b>, in which we treat fMRI not merely as a tool for reading brain activity, but also as a means of <b>manipulating</b> it. This is made possible through <b>closed-loop (i.e., real-time) imaging methods</b>, where the occurrence of specific activity patterns is paired with <b>reward or other stimuli</b>. For example, we can pair the neural representation of a <b>phobic target</b> (e.g., spiders) with reward, thereby reducing its threat value and lowering excessive physiological arousal when the subject later views images of that target. We are currently working to make this method more <b>robust and effective</b>.

      <!-- Paragraph 3 -->
      <p>
        To advance this line of research, we also conduct parallel studies in <b>animal models</b>, where we can simultaneously observe <b>hemodynamic activity</b> and <b>electrophysiological signals</b> using <b>optical (calcium) imaging</b>. These studies also allow us to apply <b>optogenetic stimulation</b> to specific brain regions. This work leverages both our <b>human MRI facilities (7T)</b> and our <b>rodent MRI platforms (9.4T and 15.2T)</b>.

        In addition, Hakwan Lau has long maintained an interest in <b>theories and models of perceptual metacognition</b>. More recently, our group has begun collaborating with <b>AI researchers</b> to explore how their theoretical models might <b>plausibly apply to the human brain</b>.
